# This file ensures the ssl/ directory is tracked in git
# SSL certificates should be placed here for HTTPS configuration
# 
# Expected files:
# - cert.pem (SSL certificate)
# - key.pem (Private key)
#
# For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
#   -subj "/C=TR/ST=Istanbul/L=Istanbul/O=Agent-Automation/CN=localhost"
